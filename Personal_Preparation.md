7. What is VPC peering?

VPC peering is a networking connection between two Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) in a cloud environment, allowing them to communicate with each other securely. VPC peering enables the sharing of resources and services between different VPCs within the same cloud provider.

8. What is the aim of VPC peering?

the primary aim of VPC peering is to enable direct and secure communication between Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) within a cloud environment. VPC peering facilitates the exchange of network traffic between different VPCs, allowing resources in each VPC to communicate with each other as if they were part of the same network

9. Why use VPC peering, real-time example?

using VPC peering in a multi-tiered application architecture improves communication efficiency, enhances security, reduces latency, supports scalability, and simplifies network architecture, making it a valuable tool for building robust and efficient cloud-based applications.

10. What is SG?

- **Definition:** In the context of cloud computing platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Microsoft Azure, a Security Group (SG) is a fundamental component for controlling inbound and outbound traffic to and from cloud resources such as virtual machines (EC2 instances).
- **Functionality:** Security Groups act as virtual firewalls that control the traffic allowed to reach resources within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) or a similar network construct. They are stateful, meaning that if you allow inbound traffic from a specific IP address, the corresponding outbound reply traffic is automatically permitted.

11. What is cloud front/CDN?

Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). A CDN is a distributed network of servers strategically placed at multiple locations worldwide to deliver web content, including static and dynamic assets, such as images, videos, stylesheets, and scripts, to users more efficiently. The goal is to reduce latency, accelerate content delivery, and improve the overall user experience.

12. What is a lambda, what is the use of it?

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows you to run code without provisioning or managing servers. Instead of worrying about infrastructure, AWS Lambda automatically scales and manages the compute resources needed to execute your code in response to events. Lambda is designed to help developers build scalable and cost-effective applications.

13. What have you developed using Lambda?

Developers use Lambda for automating data processing tasks, such as transforming and loading data into databases, analyzing log files, or generating reports.

14. What automation have you done with lambda?

15. What is cloud watch?

Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to collect and track metrics, collect and monitor log files, and set alarms. CloudWatch provides insights into the performance and operational health of AWS resources and applications, helping users gain a better understanding of their cloud environment.

16. What is cloud formation?

AWS CloudFormation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that enables you to define and provision AWS infrastructure as code (IaC). Instead of manually configuring and managing resources through the AWS Management Console or using the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), CloudFormation allows you to declare your infrastructure in a template format, which is then used to create and provision resources in a consistent and repeatable manner.
